# Vacation Ecommerce Application
### Introduction
This application was built as a final project for the Western Governor's University Back-end Programming course. For this task, I created the entire back-end using Spring, while an Angular frontend was provided.

## Installation
Front-end files can be found in the D288-labFiles folder. Open your command prompt and change directory to D288-labFiles. Once in the correct directory, enter the ```ng serve --open``` command, and the frontend will open your browser on http://localhost:4200/

For the backend, open with IntelliJ or your chosen IDE with the required libraries. Once loaded, run the program and open your browser to http://localhost:8080/

## Technologies
